### Challenge 3 :

Make a writeup explaining the concept of an IQ signal. Refer to the GNU Radio wiki. 

**Ans :** 
* In my understanding the  Quadrature signal , additionally referred to as IQ signals, IQ facts or IQ samples, are frequently used in RF(radio frequency) programs. They shape the basis of complicated RF(radio frequency) sign modulation and demodulation, each in hardware as well as in software, in addition to in complicated sign analysis.
* And we could find that the pair of periodic signals are said to be in "quadrature" when they differ in phase by 90 degrees.
* Symbols : The capital letter I in IQ represents the amplitude of the *in-phase* signal, and the capital letter Q in IQ represents the amplitude of the *quadrature signal*. 
* The important is IQ signals is that they are always *amplitude-modulated*, not frequency or phase-modulated.
* Software Defined Radio (SDR) systems use these concepts extensively because the baseband IQ signals are often represented as discrete time sampled data. Therefore, digital signal processing (DSP) can be used to literally define the transmitter and receiver characteristics including filtering, modulation and demodulation, AGC, etc.
* Eg for IQ signal is basically is the sine wave and the cosine wave.
